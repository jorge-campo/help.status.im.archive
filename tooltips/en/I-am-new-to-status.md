# Getting started with Status

Status is a unique messaging app that combines decentralized technology, privacy-focused design, and Web3 capabilities to offer a unique and secure communication experience.

Your Status keys are the foundation of your self-sovereign identity in Web3. They serve as a secure means of accessing and managing your personal information and identity. With Status, you own, control, and manage your data and digital identity without relying on centralized organisations.

Choose one of these options to create your Status profile:

## Generate keys

Create a pair of cryptographic keys representing your Status identity. Unlike centralized apps, Status doesn't rely on your username or email address to identify your profile. Instead, it uses your private and public keys. This option creates a new Ethereum address.

## Generate keys from a recovery phrase

You can use your existing Ethereum address to create your Status profile. If you already use a non-custodial Ethereum wallet (like Metamask or Trust Wallet), you already have an Ethereum address and a recovery phrase.

Your keys are always securely stored on your device and protected by your Status password.

## Generate keys on a Keycard

 A Keycard is a physical card (similar to a credit card) that securely stores your Status keys. Using a Keycard adds an extra layer of security to your digital assets and identity. This option creates a new Ethereum address.
