*[block]: A block is a structure within the blockchain. Each block has a unique ID and consists of multiple transactions.
*[blockchain]: A blockchain is a digital ledger that stores information across a network of computers,  making it difficult to modify or hack. It consists of blocks of data, each connected to the previous one, forming a chain.
*[DeFi]: DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, refers to a financial system built on blockchain technology that operates independently from traditional banks and financial institutions. This includes crypto loans and deposits, as well as token swapping and liquidity pools.
*[pen-and-paper backup]: A pen-and-paper backup refers to a physical copy of important documents or notes. You can use this backup in case of loss or damage to the original information.
*[mainnet]: The primary Ethereum blockchain network.
*[pseudonymous]: All blockchain data is pseudonymous. This means that while everyone can view your balance and transaction history, there's no way to tie any of this data to your real-life identity. That's true unless you reveal who you are yourself: for example, by sending money to your wallet from a centralized exchange such as Kraken, Coinbase or Gemini that requires you to confirm your identity.
