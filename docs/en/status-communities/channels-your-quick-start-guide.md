# Channels: your quick start guide

In [Status Communities][how-to-use-communities-your-quick-start-guide], you have access to dedicated spaces called channels. Channels bring the right people and information together for any project or topic. A channel conversation focuses on specific topics, and you can [join](./join-a-channel.md) and [leave](./leave-a-channel.md) the conversation anytime.

As a community owner, you can use channels to break down a large community into smaller, more focused sub-groups. With Status, you can [configure channel permissions][configure-channel-permissions] based on token ownership. For example, you can make a public channel private or read-only by only allowing holders of specific tokens to join or post.

!!! tip
    To add channels to your community, check out [Create a channel][create-a-channel].

=== ":mobile-one: Community information"
    Information about the community, such as the number of members, active users, or the main community topics.

=== ":mobile-two: Channel categories"
    Community owners can group related channels into [categories][create-a-channel]. This is especially helpful for communities with a large number of channels.

=== ":mobile-three: Channels list"
    The list of available channels in a community. [Private channels][configure-channel-permissions] show a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon next to the channel name.

## Public and private channels

All members in a [Status Community][how-to-use-communities-your-quick-start-guide] can browse and join public channels. For private channels, you must [meet the token requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-channels] to join the channel. To maintain access to private channels, hold the necessary tokens at all times.

!!! note
    Messages in a [private community][how-to-use-communities-your-quick-start-guide] or private channel are always end-to-end encrypted.

=== ":mobile-one: Channel information" 
    You can see the channel name and permissions here. Private channels show a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon. From this area, you can select **more options** :mobile-more-options: to access additional channel information, such as channel members, permissions or notifications.

=== ":mobile-two: Pinned message area"
    Channel members can [pin messages][pin-a-message] to this area, like announcements, FAQs or channel rules.

=== ":mobile-three: Channel feed"
    This area shows the channel activity, including messages, photos, reactions or links.

=== ":mobile-four: Message field"
    Includes the available messaging options to help you communicate and connect with people, like [images][share-images-in-status], [text][send-and-read-messages], emojis or [audio messages][send-an-audio-message].

## The #general channel

The #general channel is created by default when you [create a community][create-a-status-community]. You can use this channel for various purposes, including sharing news, discussing community policies and events or making announcements.

This channel works like any other channel. As a community administrator, here's how you can make this channel more helpful:

- Don't rename the channel. The #general channel is widely recognized and understood in communities. Renaming the channel may confuse members.
- [Set up permissions][configure-channel-permissions] to restrict who can post in #general. This removes noise from the channel and keeps it on topic.
- Use the #general channel to [pin messages][pin-a-message] describing FAQs, community rules or other information relevant to your community.
