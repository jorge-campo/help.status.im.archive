# Manage community join request

As a community owner, you can manually approve requests from people who want to join your community. With this option enabled, you receive a notification whenever someone requests to join your community. This way, you can decide whether to accept, reject or ignore the request.

## What to expect

- If a community owner rejects a join request, the person who sent the request isn't notified.
- The community screen is where the user can find out if their request was approved or denied.
- In addition to manual approval, you can set up [token requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-communities] to join communities. Manual approval and token requirements work independently.
- If your community node is offline (for example, when you turn off your computer), automatic join requests stop working. Manual join requests time out in seven days. Keep the Status desktop app running as much as possible.
