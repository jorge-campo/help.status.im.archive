# About the different types of Status Communities

## Types

In Status, there are different types of communities, and your ability to access them varies. Your access can be affected by three factors listed in the table:

| Community type | Factor | Control | Note |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Open communities | [Token requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-communities] | Community admins | Not token-gated communities. You don't need to hold any tokens to join. |
| Closed communities | | | Token-gated communities. You need to hold required tokens to join. |
| Join approval not required | [Join approval][about-community-request-approvals] | Community admins | You can join the communities directly if you meet the token requirements, or there's no token requirement. |
| Join approval required | | | You can join the communities after the community admins approve it. |
| Public communities | Community vote | SNT token holders in the community | You can see the community in the community directory. |
| Private communities | | | You can't see the community in the community directory. |

## Example

!!! note
    Your access to a community depends on the combination of the three factors. For example, a community can be both open and private, and at the same time, you need to wait for the admin to approve your join request.
