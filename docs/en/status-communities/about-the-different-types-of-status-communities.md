# About the different types of Status Communities

## Different types of Status Communities

In Status, there are different types of communities, and your ability to access them varies. Your access can be affected by three factors listed in the table:

| Community type | Factor | Control | Note |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Token-gated communities | [Token requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-communities] | Community admins | You need to hold required tokens to join. |
| Open communities | | | Not token-gated communities. You are not required to hold any specific tokens to join.|
| Join approval required | [Join approval][about-community-request-approvals] | Community admins | You need to wait for the community admin to approve your join request. |
| Join approval not required | | | You can join the communities directly if you meet the token requirements, or there's no token requirement. |
| Private communities | Community vote | SNT token holders | You can't find the community in Discover Communities. |
| Public communities | | | You can find the community in Discover Communities. |

!!! note
    Your access to a community depends on the combination of the three factors. For example, a community can be both open and private, and at the same time, you need to wait for the admin to approve your join request.

## Examples of different communities

Imagine you're a fan of a digital artist who manages a Status Community. This community is specifically for those who own the artist's issued collectibles. In this case, the artist's community could be closed and public, and it doesn't require approval for join requests. Thus, the artist could build a larger fan base more quickly.

Consider another situation where your employer maintains a Status Community for all its employees. Your company could choose to create a community that is open and private, and it requires approval for join requests. In this way, your employer could verify users' identities before they join and would not receive irrelevant join requests.
