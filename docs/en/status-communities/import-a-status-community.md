# Import a Status Community

To import a Status Community, you use the community's public key. This key is a large string of characters that helps you find the community you want to join. To make sharing and importing communities easier, Status includes the community's public key in a QR code or link, like this one: `https://join.status.im/c/zQ3shMtRomXyM5svciMpdK7zDaR12XDeQWbzi4Fb8E6YywDrE`.

This link contains the community's public key at the end, so you don't have to type it in. Use the QR code, the whole link or just the key to import the community you're interested in. Importing a community can be helpful when you can't find the community or when someone shares the community QR code or link.

!!! note
    If you're a community owner and want to restore your community on a different device, read [Restore your Status Community][restore-your-status-community].
