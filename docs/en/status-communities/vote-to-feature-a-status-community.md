# Vote to feature a Status Community

If you're passionate about a community and wish for more people to discover it, you can vote for it to be featured.

All SNT holders can vote for their favourite public communities. The five top communities get a spot in the Featured section in Communities, making them more visible to everyone.

## Vote to feature a Status Community

Votes happen on the [Community Directory Curation dApp :octicons-tab-external-16:][curate.status.app].

Your voting power is determined by how many SNT tokens you stake. You don't spend the tokens to vote, but you must hold the tokens during validation and finalization periods.

A [gas fee][understand-network-fees] in ETH is required for initiating, validating and finalizing a vote. These steps are not required for every voter.

Voting involves five steps:

- [x] [Connect your wallet][connect-the-wallet].
- [x] [Initiate a round of vote][initiate-voting].
- [x] [Cast your vote][cast-the-vote].
- [x] [Verify the vote][verify-the-vote].
- [x] [Finalize the vote][finalize-the-vote].

!!! note
    Status does not charge you any fees for voting.

    To know more about the dApp and the rules of each step, check out [About voting to change community visibility][about-voting-to-change-community-visibility].

## Step 1: Connect your wallet {: #connect-the-wallet}

Make sure your wallet contains enough SNT for voting and ETH for the gas fee.

1. Open your wallet and switch the network to Optimism.
1. Open the Community Directory Curation dApp and select **Connect** from the top navigation.
1. From your wallet, confirm to connect.

!!! note
    You can use Status Wallet or MetaMask.

## Step 2: Initiate a round of vote {: #initiate-voting}

After the previous round of vote is finalized, a new round can be initiated. Each round lasts one week.

A round of vote starts when the first voter [cast a vote][cast-the-vote]. This initiating voter must pay a gas fee.

## Step 3: Cast your vote {: #cast-the-vote}

The voting period lasts for 5 days. Voters don't need to pay any gas fee.

1. From the top navigation, select **Directory** to view all public communities.

1. Choose the amount of SNT to stake and select **Confirm vote to feature communtiy**.
1. From your wallet, sign the vote.

## Step 4: Verify the vote {: #verify-the-vote}

After voting, a 2-day verification period begins to identify valid votes. If no one verifies the vote, only the first vote of this round is counted.

1. From the top navigation, select **Directory**.
1. Select **Verify Weekly Featured**.
1. From your wallet, confirm and pay the gas fee.

## Step 5: Finalize the vote {: #finalize-the-vote}

After the 2-day verification period, the finalization begins. At least one person must finalize the vote. Otherwise, it stays pending and no one can initiate a new round.

1. From the top navigation, select **Directory**.
1. Select **Finalize Weekly Featured**.
1. From your wallet, confirm and pay the gas fee.
