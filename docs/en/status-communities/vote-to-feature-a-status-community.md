# Vote to feature a Status Community

If you're passionate about a community and wish for more people to discover it, you can vote for it to be featured in Status app.

All SNT holders can vote for their favourite public communities. The five top communities get a spot in the Featured section in Communities, making them more visible to everyone.

## What to expect

- Votes happen on the [Community Directory Curation dApp :octicons-tab-external-16:][curate.status.app].
- In each round of vote, you can find the communities you like from Directory and vote.
- Your voting power is determined by how many SNT tokens you stake. You don't spend the tokens to vote, but you must hold the tokens you stake till the round of voting finishes.
- You should pay a [gas fee][understand-network-fees] in ETH for initiating, validating and finalizing a vote. These steps are not required for every voter.

!!! note
    Status does not charge you any fees for voting.

A round of vote involves five steps:

- [x] [connect your wallet][connect-the-wallet]
- [x] [initiate a round of vote][initiate-voting]
- [x] [cast your vote][cast-the-vote]
- [x] [verify the vote][verify-the-vote]
- [x] [finalize the vote][finalize-the-vote]

!!! tip
    To know more about the dApp and the rules of each step, check out [About voting to change community visibility][about-voting-to-change-community-visibility].

## Step 1: Connect your wallet {: #connect-the-wallet}

Make sure you open the [Community Directory Curation dApp :octicons-tab-external-16:][curate.status.app] and your wallet contains enough SNT for voting and ETH for the gas fee.

The process is for Status Wallet, but you can also try other wallets like MetaMask.

1. Open your wallet and switch the network to Optimism.
1. Open the dApp and select **Connect** from the top navigation.
1. From your wallet, confirm to connect.

## Step 2: Initiate a round of vote {: #initiate-voting}

After the previous round of vote is finalized, a new round can be initiated. Each round lasts one week.

A round of vote starts when the first voter [cast a vote][cast-the-vote]. This initiating voter must pay a gas fee.

## Step 3: Cast your vote {: #cast-the-vote}

The voting period lasts for five days. Voters don't pay any gas fee.

1. From the top navigation of the dApp, select **Directory** to view all public communities.
1. Find the community you want to vote for and select **Feature this community!**
1. Choose the amount of SNT to stake and select **Confirm vote to feature communtiy**.
1. From your wallet, sign the vote.

## Step 4: Verify the vote {: #verify-the-vote}

After voting, a 2-day verification period begins to identify valid votes. If no one verifies the vote, only the first vote of this round is counted.

1. From the top navigation of the dApp, select **Directory**.
1. Select **Verify Weekly Featured**.
1. From your wallet, confirm and pay the gas fee.

## Step 5: Finalize the vote {: #finalize-the-vote}

After the two-day verification period, the finalization begins. At least one person must finalize the vote. Otherwise, the current round of vote stays pending and no one can initiate a new round.

1. From the top navigation of the dApp, select **Directory**.
1. Select **Finalize Weekly Featured**.
1. From your wallet, confirm and pay the gas fee.

!!! note
    After the finalization period, the top five communities with the highest number of SNT tokens are showcased in the Featured section.
