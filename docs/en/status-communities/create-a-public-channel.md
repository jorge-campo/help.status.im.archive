# Create a public channel

!!! note ""
    Create a public channel is only available in Status desktop.

With Status, you can organize your conversations with your contacts into designated spaces called [channels](channels-your-quick-start-guide.md). Channels bring the right people and information together for a common purpose, like a specific project or topic.

In Status, you can create a public channel if you are the community's owner or admin. You do not need to specify token requirements to create a public channel. All members of a [community][about-status-communities] can browse and [join public channels][join-a-channel].
