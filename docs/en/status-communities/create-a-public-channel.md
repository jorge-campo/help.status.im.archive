# Create a channel and add permissions

!!! note ""
    Currently, you can only create a channel and add permissions using Status desktop.

Community owners can create public and private channels in the status app. Public channels are accessible for all community members to browse and join. A private channel is not accessible to all community members. As a community owner, you must configure specific permissions to create a private channel. <!--To join a private channel, you must meet channel requirements. To maintain access to private channels, hold the necessary tokens at all times.-->
