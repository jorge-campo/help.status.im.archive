# Create a channel

!!! note ""
    Create a channel is only available in Status desktop.

The status app has two types of [channels][channels-your-quick-start-guide]: public and private. Public channels are accessible for all [community][about-status-communities] members to browse and join without specific requirements. A private channel is not accessible to all community members. To create a private channel, you need to configure specific permissions. To join a private channel, you must meet specific permissions configured by the channel owner. To maintain access to private channels, hold the necessary tokens at all times.

By default, only community owners and admins can create channels and configure permissions.
