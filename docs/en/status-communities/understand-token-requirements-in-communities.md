# Understand token requirements in communities

<!--

-->

In Status, there are two kinds of [communities][join-a-status-community]: public and private. If you want to join a private community, you need to meet the token requirements set by the community owner. To maintain access to a private community, hold the necessary tokens at all times.

Community owners can set up token requirements for their communities. To join a community, you need to meet its token requirements. For example, a community owner can set up owning 10 SNTs as a requirement to join a community. In that case, you need to have a minimum of 10 SNTs to join that community.

There are three kinds of tokens in the Status app: assets, collectibles, and ENS (Ethereum Name Service) names. Community owners can set up any combination of these tokens as a requirement to join their communities.

!!! note
    When you join a private community, the token required to join are not transferred to anyone. They remain on your account. They are simply used for verification purposes, and your tokens remain in your possession.

## You meet the requirements

Before you join a private community, the Status app automatically checks if you meet the community requirements. If you meet the requirements, the option to join the community is available.

!!! note
    If the community owner has set [manual approval][manage-community-join-request] option for their community, you still need the owner's approval to join.

## You don't meet the token requirements

If the request button is greyed out and unavailable, it means that you don't meet the token requirements to join a community in the Status app. To apply to join the community, you need to have the required amount of tokens.
