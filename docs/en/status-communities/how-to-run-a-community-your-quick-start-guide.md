## First steps

## Administer your community

Status uses a decentralized architecture.

With the control node, you can Administer your members and membership, set up Token and token-based permissions, run the [Community History Service][about-the-community-history-service], etc.

If you want someone to help you with the administration, you can [delegate admin functions to community members][delegate-admin-functions-to-community-members].
