# How to run a community: your quick start guide

A Status Community is a virtual space for like-minded people to exchange ideas and collaborate.

As a community owner, you have the autonomy to oversee membership and administration. This enables you to shape the community's dynamics and ensure a positive atmosphere that fosters engagement and productive interactions.

## Set up your community

First, [create][create-a-status-community] a community and [customize][customize-your-community] it based on what xx. If you already operate a Discord community server, you can [import it into Status][import-a-discord-community-into-status].

In your community, you can [set up channels][create-a-channel] for different discussion topics and [customize them][customize-your-channel].

## Administer your members and membership

After you create the community, users can check the details and join your community from the Status Community directory (?. To let more people know about your community, you and your community members can [invite people to join][invite-people-to-a-status-community] by sharing the links to your community.

You can set up the requirement for joining the community. There are two ways to restrict who can join your community:

    1. Turn on manual approval for join requests [manage-community-join-requests]. 
    1. Set up token requirements for your [community][set-up-a-closed-community].

If a community member behaves inappropriately, you can [kick or ban the user][kick-or-ban-someone-from-your-community].

## Administer your community

Status uses a decentralized architecture. When you create a community, your computer becomes a [control node][about-the-control-node-in-status-communities] that is responsible? for community administration. With the control node, you can Administer your members and membership, set up Token and token-based permissions, run the [Community History Service][about-the-community-history-service], etc.




## Token and token-based permissions

In Status Communities, there are three types of roles: owner, admin and member. The different roles have [unique permissions][permissions-by-role-in-status-communities] that allow them to perform corresponding actions like deleting messages or editing community settings. 

As the community owner, you have full access to all permissions. You can [customize the permissions your memebers hold][set-up-your-community-permissions]. For example, you can create [closed channels][set-up-a-closed-channel] that only members who hold the required tokens can join. If you want someone to help you with the administration, you can create admins by [delegating admin functions to community members][delegate-admin-functions-to-community-members].

These are realized using tokens including virtual coins, collectibles and domain names. You need to [mint][mint-tokens-for-your-community] and [airdrop][how-to-airdrop-tokens-in-status] tokens.
