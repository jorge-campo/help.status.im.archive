# How to run a community: your quick start guide

A Status Community is a virtual space for like-minded people to exchange ideas and collaborate.

As a community owner, you have the autonomy to oversee membership and administration. This enables you to shape the community's dynamics and ensure a positive atmosphere that fosters engagement and productive interactions.

## Set up your community and channels

First, create your community and set up channels in the community. Think of channels as rooms, each with a unique theme, helping keep discussions focused and organized.

=== ":mobile-one: Community"

    [Create][create-a-status-community] a community and [customize][customize-your-community] it according to the specific topic and style of your choice. If you already operate a Discord community server, you can [import it into Status][import-a-discord-community-into-status].

=== ":mobile-two: Channels"

If a community member behaves inappropriately, you can [kick or ban the user][kick-or-ban-someone-from-your-community].

## Administer your members and membership {: #administer-membership}

As the community owner, you have control over how Status users can access your community.

### Increase members

After you create the community, you and your community members can [invite people to join][invite-people-to-a-status-community] by :mobile-one: sending the community to contacts in Status, or sharing the :mobile-two: QR code or :mobile-three: link to your community with others. To increase your community's visibility, you can [initiate a vote to add your community in the Discover Communities section][vote-to-make-a-community-private-or-public].

### Restrict access

There are [two factors][about-the-different-types-of-status-communities] under your control to restrict access to your community. You can set a token requirement for joining your [community][set-up-a-closed-community] or specific [channels][set-up-a-closed-channel]. Alternatively, turn on [manual approval for join requests][manage-community-join-requests].

For example, suppose you're a digital artist who wants to create an community only for those owning your art. In this case, you could create a closed community requiring members to hold the collectibles you issued. If you want to verify users' identities before they join, you could enable manual approval for join requests.
    
Additionaly, if a community member misbehaves, you can [kick or ban the user][kick-or-ban-someone-from-your-community].
    
## Token and token-based permissions {: #token-based-permissions}

Tokens serve as a means for you to motivate members and manage permissions. You can [mint][mint-tokens-for-your-community] and [airdrop][how-to-airdrop-tokens-in-status] tokens including virtual coins and collectible within your community.

In Status Communities, there are three types of roles: owner, admin and member. The different roles have [unique permissions][permissions-by-role-in-status-communities] that allow them to perform corresponding actions like deleting messages or editing community settings.

### Customize permissions

As the community owner, you have full access to all permissions, and you can [customize the permissions your members hold][set-up-your-community-permissions]. The easiest method to do this is by using ENS domains.

For example, you can [grant exclusive excess][grant-exclusive-access-with-tokens] by setting a rule that members must hold a certain token to post in specific channels.

### Delegate admin functions

If you want someone to help you with community administration, you can designate some members as admins by [delegating admin functions to community members][delegate-admin-functions-to-community-members]. The easiest method to do this is by using ENS domains.

### Encourage participation

Tokens can function as a tool to incentivize active participation among your members. For example, a game developer could create and distribute exclusive virtual items exclusively to those who demonstrate high engagement within the community.

## Administer your community

After creating a community, your computer becomes a [control node][about-the-control-node-in-status-communities], taking on the responsibility of maintenance and administration. To provide the best experience for your members, keep the Status desktop app acting as the control node online every day or at least once every six days.

With the control node, you can carry out the tasks discussed earlier, such as [administer your members and membership][administer-membership] and [set up token-based permissions][token-based-permissions]. You also use it to maintain historical messages via the [Community History Service][about-the-community-history-service].

!!! tip
    [Turning off the CHS][turn-off-the-community-history-service] significantly reduces community members' experience. Keep it on unless it's really necessary.
