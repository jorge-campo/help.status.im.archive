# Configure channel permissions

!!! note ""
    Currently, you can only configure channel permissions using Status desktop.

You configure permission using three different elements: Who holds, Is allowed to and In. For each one of them, follow the same procedure and use the table below as a reference.

## What to expect

* If you delete a private channel, the permissions you configured for the channel are also lost. If you want to recreate the channel, you need to configure its permissions again.

* You can monetise your channels.

* If you create a private channel, you can require holding a token to obtain exclusive membership rights.
