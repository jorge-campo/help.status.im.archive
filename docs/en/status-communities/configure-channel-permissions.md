# Configure channel permissions

!!! note ""
    Currently, you can only configure channel permissions using Status desktop.

Community owners can configure permission using three different variables: Who holds, Is allowed to and In. For each one of them, follow the same procedure and use the table below as a reference.

## What to expect

* Using channel permissions, community owners can restrict channel access and actions to specific people based on token requirements.

* Only the community owner can configure channel permissions.

* When you delete a private channel, the channel permissions are lost. If you recreate the channel, you need to configure its permission again.
