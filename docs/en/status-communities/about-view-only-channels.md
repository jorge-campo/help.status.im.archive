## Using a view-only channel

View-only channels can help keep your community organized and focused. Here are some examples of using view-only channels.

- **Community announcements and updates**

    To keep important announcements or updates clutter-free, use a view-only channel. Only community owners and admins can write in these channels, ensuring your message is delivered without distractions.

- **Information sharing**

    If there are specific resources or guidelines that members need to access regularly, a view-only channel serves as a convenient and easy-to-find repository. For example, you can share information that new community members may find helpful.

- **Learning communities**

    In learning communities, view-only channels allow owners to share exercises and training materials while keeping the conversation focused.

- **Voting or pooling areas**

    Because members with view-only access can still [react][react-and-reply-to-messages] to messages in view-only channels, owners can use them for voting on different topics or proposals.
