When a community is created, it's private by default. A public community can be found on the [Discover page][find-communities-to-join] in Communities, while a private community is not listed on this page.

It is not one individual who decides whether a community is public or private, but the voting result. All SNT holders can vote, not just community members or Status users.

!!! note
    Apart from public and private communities, there are [other types of Status communities][about-the-different-types-of-status-communities].

## Vote to make a community private or public

Votes happen on the [community directory curation dApp :octicons-tab-external-16:][curate.status.app]. Your voting power is determined by how many SNT tokens you stake. You don't spend the tokens to vote, but you must hold the tokens during validation and finalization periods. A [gas fee][understand-network-fees] in ETH is required for initiating, validating and finalizing a vote.

Voting involves five steps:

- [x] [Connect your wallet][connect-wallet].
- [x] [Initiate a voting process][initiate-vote].
- [x] [Cast your vote][cast-vote].
- [x] [Verify the vote][verify-vote].
- [x] [Finalize the vote][finalize-vote].

!!! note
    Status does not charge you any fees for voting.

!!! note
    To know more about the dApp and the rules of each step, check out [About voting to change community visibility][about-voting-to-change-community-visibility].

## Step 1: Connect your wallet {: #connect-wallet}

Make sure your wallet contains enough SNT for voting and ETH for the gas fee.

1. Open your wallet and switch the network to Optimism.
1. Open the community directory curation dApp and select **Connect** from the top navigation.
1. Select **Confirm** in your wallet.

!!! note
    You can use Status Wallet or MetaMask.

## Step 2: Initiate a voting process {: #initiate-vote}

Initiate a vote if there isn't an ongoing vote for the community you want to add or remove. Afterwards, other SNT holders can participate.

## Step 4: Verify the vote {: #verify-vote}

After voting, the 7-day verification period begins. During this period, valid votes are identified.

1. Open the dApp and find the vote to verify.
1. Select **Verify the vote**
1. Confirm the transaction and pay the gas fee from your wallet.

## Step 5: Finalize the vote {: #finalize-vote}

!!! note
    After finalization, the community is added or removed from Discover based on the voting result.
