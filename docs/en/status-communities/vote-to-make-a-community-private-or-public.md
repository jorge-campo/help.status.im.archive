A public community appears on the [Discover page][find-communities-to-join] in Communities, while a private community does not.

Whether a community is public or private is determined by a vote, open to all SNT holders, not just community members or Status users.

!!! note
    Apart from public and private communities, there are [other types of Status communities][about-the-different-types-of-status-communities].

## Vote to make a community private or public

Votes happen on the [community directory curation dApp :octicons-tab-external-16:][curate.status.app].

Your voting power is determined by how many SNT tokens you stake. You don't spend the tokens to vote, but you must hold the tokens during validation and finalization periods. 

A [gas fee][understand-network-fees] in ETH is required for initiating, validating and finalizing a vote. These steps are not required for every voter.

Voting involves five steps:

- [x] [Connect your wallet][connect-wallet].
- [x] [Initiate a voting process][initiate-vote].
- [x] [Cast your vote][cast-vote].
- [x] [Verify the vote][verify-vote].
- [x] [Finalize the vote][finalize-vote].

!!! note
    Status does not charge you any fees for voting.
