# Vote to make a community private or public

![A header image of the Communities section.](./vote-to-make-a-community-private-or-public/676-0-1.png)

A voting process determines whether a community is public or private. A public community appears on the [Discover page][find-communities-to-join] in Communities, while a private community does not.

## What to expect

-  All SNT holders, not just community members or Status users, can participate in the voting.
- Votes happen on the [community directory curation dApp :octicons-tab-external-16:][curate.status.app].
- Your voting power is determined by how many SNT tokens you stake.
- You don't spend the tokens to vote, but you must hold the tokens you stake during the [verification][verify-the-vote] and [finalization][finalize-the-vote] periods.

!!! note
    Status does not charge you any fees for voting.

Voting involves five steps. These steps are not required for every voter.

| Voting step | Who can participate | Gas fee required |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1. [Connect your wallet][connect-wallet] | Any SNT holder | No |
| 2. [Initiate a voting process][initiate-vote] | Any SNT holder, at least one person | Yes |
| 3. [Cast your vote][cast-vote] | Any SNT holder | No |
| 4. [Verify the vote][verify-vote] | Any SNT holder, at least one person | Yes |
| 5. [Finalize the vote][finalize-vote] | Any SNT holder, at least one person | Yes |
