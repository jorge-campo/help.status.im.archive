# Manage community join request

<!--
image (not sure about this, ask Jorge)
-->
As a community owner, you can manually approve a request from people who wants to join your community. With this option enabled, you receive a notification whenever someone requests to join your community. That way <!--by doing so/ this way-->, you can decide whether to accept, reject or ignore the request.

## What to expect

<!--
    - what happens if I reject a request? will the person receive a notification? 
    - How can she/he find out about this? 
    - what happens if I ignore the request?
    - In addition to manual approval, you can configure [token requirements][] to join their communities. Manual approval and token requirements work independently.
