### Step 1: select the token to airdrop

You can airdrop assets or collectibles from your community, mint new assets or collectibles or import existing tokens.

If the asset you want to airdrop exists in more than one network, you can choose the network to airdrop. Collectibles are unique digital items on a specific blockchain network with a distinct ownership record.

    1. Click **New Airdrop**.
    1. For the `What` variable, click :desktop-plus: **Add** next to the variable and choose the **Asset** or **Collectible** tab, depending on what you want to airdrop.
    1. In the token selection dialog, choose the asset or collectible to airdrop.
    1. For assets, choose the network to airdop if you asset exits in more than one network.
    1. Enter the amount to airdrop and click **Add**.

!!! note
    You can airdrop different tokens in the same airdrop. After adding your token, click :desktop-plus: **Add** again to add a new one.

    Next to each asset and collectible, you can see the avialble token supply to airdrop or the infinity symbol for tokens with infinite supply. For more information about this options, check out [Mint tokens for your community][mint-tokens-for-your-community].

### Step 2: choose the airdrop recipients

You can airdrop tokens to your community members or specific Ethereum addresses and you can airdrop to up to 49 recipients in total.

=== "Desktop"

    1. For the `To` variable, click :desktop-plus: **Add** next to the variable.
    1. Choose :desktop-address: **ETH addresses** or :desktop-member: **Community members**.
    1. For Ethereum addresses, enter the address hexadecimal values separated by comma (,).
    1. For community members, check the box next to the community members you want to airdrop tokens. Alternatively, check the **Select all** box to select all your community members.
    1. Click :desktop-plus: **Add** again if you need to add other types of recipients.

### Step 3: validate your options and create the airdrop

After you enter the recipients list, the Status app calculates the network fees 

=== "Desktop"

    1. In the :desktop-fees: **Fees** verify the gas fee required by the network.
    1. Select the account you want to use to pay for the gas fee. If you airdrop tokens in more than one network, you can see the network fees required by each transaction.

The Status app shows the progress of the airdrop process.
