# Import or restore your Status Community

!!! note ""
     Currently, you can only import or restore communities using Status desktop.

Using your community key, you can import or restore your Status Community onto another device. You can also use this key to [transfer community ownership][transfer-your-community-s-ownership].

The community key is a large string of characters stored in the Status app and protected by your Status password. Be careful handling this key. Anyone with access to your community key may become the community owner with complete control over its settings, permission and membership.

!!! note
    Status will never ask you for your community key, and anyone who does is trying to steal your community.
