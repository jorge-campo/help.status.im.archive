# Transfer your community's ownership

You can transfer your Status Community ownership to someone else if you can't manage it. To transfer your community's ownership, you need a [backup of your community's private key][back-up-your-community-s-private-key].

When you transfer the community's ownership, the new owner's computer becomes a new community node with full control of the community, including its settings, permissions and membership approvals.

!!! tip
    If you need help managing your community, consider adding others as admins. For more information, check out Co-manage your Status Community.

Transfering your community ownership follows the same method as restoring your community. For more information and a step-by-step guide, read [Restore your Status Community][restore-your-status-community].
