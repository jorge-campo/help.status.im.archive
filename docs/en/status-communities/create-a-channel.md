# Create a channel

!!! note ""
    Currently, you can only create a channel and add permissions using Status desktop.

Community owners can create public and private channels in the Status app. Public channels are available for all community members to browse and join. A private channel is only available to members who meet the [channel requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-channels]. As a community owner, configure specific permissions to create a private channel.

## Create a channel

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click the community where you want to create a channel.
    1. In the **Community** sidebar, right-click and select **Create Channel**.
    1. Type your **Channel name**. Optionally, click :desktop-emojis: to choose an emoji.
    1. Optionally, choose a **Channel colour** and add a **Description** of your channel.
    1. Click **Create Channel**.

If you need to configure additional permission, click **Add permissions** and check out [configure channel permissions][configure-channel-permissions]. For example, if you want to create a read-only announcement channel or a channel that members can view and post.
