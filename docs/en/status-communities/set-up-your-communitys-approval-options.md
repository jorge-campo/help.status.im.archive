# Set up your community's approval options < ## !-- find a better title. Se nao conseguir devo separar os dois artigos.-->

As a community owner, you can manually approve a request from people who wants to join your community. With this option enabled, you receive a notification whenever someone requests to join your community. This way, you can decide whether to accept, reject or ignore the request.

## What to expect

- If a community owner rejects a joining request, the person who sent the request will not be notified.
- The community screen is where you can find out if your request was approved or denied.
- In addition to manual approval, you can configure [token requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-communities] to join communities. Manual approval and token requirements work independently.
- <!-- talk about ignore? Sim! add a informação sobre 7 dias.-->
