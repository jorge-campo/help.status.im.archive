!!! tip ""
    Currently, community permissions can only be customized using Status desktop.

In the Status app, community owners and admins can use token-based permissions to organize and control their communities and channels. ~~Using tokens, you can create and manage access levels within your community and its channels with great flexibility and customization.~~

Owners can apply token-based permission to both [your community as a whole][set-up-your-community-permissions] and individual [channels within it][set-up-channel-permissions]. This gives you the power to set up open communities with specific token-gated channels or [entirely closed communities][set-up-a-private-community] that require certain tokens for access.

!!! note ""
    Both community owners and admins can define token-based permission using Status desktop. For more information, check out [Permissions by role in Status Communities][permissions-by-role-in-status-communities].

## Define and assign token-base permissions

To define different access levels in your community, you start with a token. This can be an existing token (such as ETH, SNT or an ENS name), a new token you mint or a token you import into the community.

## Using token-based access in your community

Let's explore some example of how you can use token-based permissions in the Status app.

### Early access to content

As a content creator, you can set up a Status community for your fans. By minting and airdropping tokens, you can give certain fans access to an exclusive channel where you release content before it's available elsewhere, adding value to your community.

### Community administration

Token-based permissions in Status Communities allow community owners to restrict access and delegate administrative functions to specific token holders. For more information, check out [Delegate admin functions to community members][delegate-admin-functions-to-community-members].

!!! note
    You're always in control of your community. You can [remove permissions] or [destroy admin tokens] if necessary.

### Organize and event or conference

If you're organizing an event, you can create a community for it. By minting tokens for a VIP channel, you can give VIP ticket holders access to exclusive information, like behind-the-scenes content or private meet-and-greets. For more infomration, check out [Grant exclusive access with tokens][grant-exclusive-access-with-tokens].

### Exclusive Business Channels

If you run a business, you can create a community to share updates about your business. You can mint tokens for specific channels, granting access only to your employees or trusted partners. This allows you to share sensitive updates and discussions without risking public exposure.

### Special Interest Groups

As a hobbyist, you can create a community around your hobby. By minting tokens, you can grant access to certain channels where like-minded individuals can share specialized knowledge or engage in specific discussions.
