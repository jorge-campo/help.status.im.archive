# Token-based access to communities and channels

!!! tip ""
    Currently, you can only configure token-based access using Status desktop.

In the Status app, community [owners and admins][permissions-by-role-in-status-communities] can use token-based permissions to organize and control their communities and channels.

As a community owner, you can configure token-based permission in [the community as a whole][set-up-your-community-permissions] and individual [channels within it][set-up-channel-permissions]. This functionality allows you to set up open communities with specific token-gated channels or [entirely closed communities][set-up-a-private-community] that require certain tokens for access.

!!! note
    Both community owners and admins can define token-based permission using Status desktop. For more information, check out [Permissions by role in Status Communities][permissions-by-role-in-status-communities].

## Define and assign token-based access

To define different access levels in your community, you start with a token.

- [x] Choose one or more tokens you want to use. This can be an existing token (such as ETH, SNT or an ENS name), [a new token you mint][mint-tokens-for-your-community] or [a token you import][import-tokens-to-your-community] into the community.
- [x] Create a new [community-level][set-up-your-community-permissions] or [channel-level][set-up-channel-permissions] permission using your the token.
- [x] You can now token-gate access to your community or channels within it. For ideas on how to use these token-based permissions, check out [Using token-based access in your community](#using-token-based-access-in-your-community).

## Using token-based access in your community

Let's explore some examples of using token-based access in the Status app.

### Provide early access to content

As a content creator, you can set up a Status community for your fans. By [minting][mint-tokens-for-your-community] and [airdropping tokens][how-to-airdrop-tokens-in-status], you can give certain fans [access to an exclusive channel][grant-exclusive-access-with-tokens] where you release content before it's available elsewhere, adding value to your community.

### Community access and administration

Token-based permissions in Status Communities allow community owners to restrict access and delegate administrative functions to specific token holders. For more information, check out [Delegate admin functions to community members][delegate-admin-functions-to-community-members].

!!! note
    You're always in control of your community. You can [remove permissions][delete-community-permissions] or [destroy admin tokens][remotely-self-destruct-a-token] if necessary.

### Run an event or conference

If you're organizing an event, you can create a Status community for it. By minting tokens for a VIP channel, you can give VIP ticket holders access to exclusive information, like behind-the-scenes content or private meet-and-greets. For more information, check out [Grant exclusive access with tokens][grant-exclusive-access-with-tokens].

### Set up exclusive business channels

If you run a business, you can create a community to share updates about your business. You can mint tokens for specific channels, granting access only to your employees or trusted partners. This approach allows you to share sensitive updates and discussions without risking public exposure. Check out [Set up a read-only channel][set-up-a-read-only-channel] and [Set up a private channel][set-up-a-private-channel] for more information. 

### Organize special interest groups

As a hobbyist, you can create a community around your hobby. By minting tokens, you can grant access to certain channels where fellow members can share specialized knowledge or engage in specific discussions. Check out [Set up a private community][set-up-a-private-community] for more information.

!!! tip
    Using token-based access, you can attract and engage like-minded individuals who are genuinely committed to your community's purpose.
