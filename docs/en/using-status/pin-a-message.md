# Pin a message

Any chat member can pin messages, both their own and those of others. Message pinning is available in direct messages, group chats and community channels.

Once you pin a message, it's highlighted and gets a label saying who pinned it.

## Pin a message

=== "Mobile"

    1. From the tab bar, tap :mobile-messages: Messages.
    2. Open the chat you want to pin a message in.
    3. Tap the message you want to pin.
    4. Tap :mobile-pin: **Pin to the chat**.
    To unpin a message, tap it and select :mobile-unpin: **Unpin**.
    
    To view all pinned messages in a group or direct messages chat, open this chat and tap :mobile-pin: **Pinned messages**. If the chat's full, tap the ribbon with the :mobile-pin: **Pin** icon underneath the chat's name.

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click :desktop-chat: **Chat**.
    2. Open the group chat you want to add new members to.
    3. Hover over the message you want to pin.
    4. Click :desktop-pin: **Pin**.
    To unpin a message, hover over it and click :desktop-unpin: **Unpin**.
    
    To view all pinned messages in a group or direct messages chat, click :desktop-pin: **N pinned messages** underneath the chat's name. In communities, this will say :desktop-pin: **N**, where N is the number of currently pinned messages.
