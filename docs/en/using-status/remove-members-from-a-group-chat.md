# Remove members from a group chat

A [group chat][understand-group-chats] owner can add their [Status contacts][send-a-contact-request] to the chat. Regular members can't add their contacts.

If you remove someone by mistake or change your mind about them later, you can always [re-add them to the chat][add-members-to-a-group-chat].
