# Send GIFs and stickers

Animated GIFs and stickers are a popular way of expressing emotions, reactions and humour in messaging apps. GIFs are short, looping animated videos of a few seconds in length, while stickers are static or animated images.

The Status app uses the [Tenor GIF :octicons-tab-external-16:][Tenor]{:target="_blank"} search engine and database for GIFs. You can also send GIFs from other sources by sending a message with the GIF URL.

You can add more stickers to default sticker sets in Status or share a sticker set with someone. See [Add, remove or share sticker sets][add-remove-or-share-sticker-sets].

!!! note
    To show the GIF preview and not the URL, [enable rich link previews][enable-rich-link-previews-in-messages] in messages.
