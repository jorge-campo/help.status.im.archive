# Messages FAQs
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

The Status app provides a privacy-centric messenger built using decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) technology and strong end-to-end encryption.

Peer-to-peer messaging don't use a centralized server or database to distribute messages. Instead, 

End-to-end encryption ensures that your communication is encrypted at all times. Neither Status nor anyone else can read the content of your messages, or know who you are or with whom you're . To know more about the technologies behind Status messaging, check 

## General questions

### What is Status messaging

Messaging is a key component of the Status app, along with the Status Communities, Status Wallet, and Web3 browser. Status messaging offers individuals and communities uncensored, private, and secure communication.


### There are other popular messaging apps. Why should I use Status?

Other messaging apps offer end-to-end encryption, but their centralized network design allows interpretation of who is talking to whom and where. These messaging apps can collect and sell your data and create a profile about you. We've built Status so your information is out of our reach. No one (not even Status) cannot obtain any data or metadata about you, censor your speech, or block you from using the Status app.

### What makes Status messaging decentralized?


### Are my messages on the blockchain?

No, your messages are not in the blockchain and not transported through the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Messages are stored on the peer-to-peer network nodes.


## Messaging

### How can I use Status messaging to chat?

You can use Status messaging to chat with people in different ways:

- Direct messages (DM)

    DMs can be one-to-one conversations, or they can be chat groups of up to XXXXXX people.

- Communities

    Status Communities [definition group of members, topics, rules?, and channels]

- Public chats

    

### I joined a public chat, but I don't see any messages. Why is that?


### Can I delete my messages?



### For how long can I access my messages?

The peer-to-peer network nodes store messages for one month, and your phone stores these messages permanently after receiving them.


## Privacy and security

### Are my messages realy private?


### What makes Status messaging censoship-resistant?

EDIT:

[[[[[Status messenger does not use one central server to and from which communication can be blocked. Instead Status uses a distributed network of 'Status nodes'. This ensures resilience of the network. If a Status node is shut down you can connect to another node or start running your own. However, Status and nodes in the network still rely on having an Internet connection. If the Internet is shut down through telecom providers you will not be able to use Status.]]]]]

### Who owns the peer-to-peer network nodes?

Anybody can run a Status network node and contribute to a more decentralized and resilient network. Currently, Status runs most nodes to ensure messages can be delivered reliably to disconnected peers. While all traffic is encrypted and out of reach of Status, we hope more users run their own nodes.
