# React and reply to messages

In Status, you can reply to specific messages and react with emojis. 

Replies are useful for when you want to make it clear who you are responding to, as well as receive a faster reply from them. Users whose messages you reply to receive notifications in their Notification Centre.

Reactions are helpful when you want to show others that you saw their message. Users whose messages you react to do not receive any notifications.
