# Add watch-only accounts to your Status Wallet

In your Status Wallet, watch-only accounts are accounts that you only keep track of, just as you can do using a [block explorer][understand-block-explorers].  Once you add a watch-only account, you can view its balance and transaction history in your Status Wallet.

You can add any Ethereum address as a watch-only account, including addresses that don't belong to you. For example, you can keep track of your own hardware wallet account or someone else's account you're simply interested in.

## What to expect

- You can add any Ethereum address as a watch-only account.
- You can't make transactions from your watch-only accounts.
- You can keep track of both tokens and collectibles that belong to your watch-only accounts.
- The balances of your watch-only accounts don't count toward your total balance in Status Wallet.
