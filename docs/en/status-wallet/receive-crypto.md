# Receive crypto

## Find your address

=== "Mobile"

    1. From the tab bar, tap :mobile-wallet: **Wallet**.
    1. In the top-right corner, tap :scan-qr: **View address**.
    1. Choose either your legacy or multichain address. For your multichain address, tap :desktop-edit: **Edit** to choose which chains you want your multichain address to feature.
    1. To copy your address, tap :mobile-copy: **Copy**.

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click :desktop-wallet: **Wallet**.
    1. Click :desktop-receive: **Receive**.
    1. Choose either your legacy or multichain address. For your multichain address, click :desktop-edit: **Edit** to choose which chains you want your multichain address to feature. 
    1. To copy your address, click :desktop-copy: **Copy address**.

## Your legacy and multichain addresses

In essence, your legacy and multichain addresses are the same address. If you're only interested in the Ethereum mainnet, you can safely use your legacy address.

If you're using any [l2s or sidechains][understand-l2s-and-sidechains], your multichain address can help signal which chains you prefer. For example, if you're using Optimism but not Arbitrum, you can click :desktop-edit: Edit on your Multichain address screen and check the boxes next to the chains you want to use. 

## What to do if you didn't receive your crypto

If someone sent you crypto and you can't see it in your Status Wallet, here's what you can do:

- Ask the sender to share a [block explorer][understand-block-explorers] link for this transaction with you. Using the link, make sure they sent your crypto to the right address. If the transaction shows up as [processing][understand-transaction-statuses], simply wait until it's completed.
- Close and re-open your Status Wallet app.
