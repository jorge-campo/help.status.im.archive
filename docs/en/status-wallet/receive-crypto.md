# Receive crypto

To receive crypto, you need to share your Ethereum address with the sender. As long as you only share your public address (which starts with `0x`), it's perfectly safe.

!!! warning
     You should never share your 12-word recovery phrase with anyone. Anyone who has your recovery phrase can manage your crypto. If someone's asking for your recovery phrase to send you crypto, they're trying to scam you.

## Find your address

=== "Mobile"

    1. From the tab bar, tap :mobile-wallet: **Wallet**.
    1. From the navigation bar, tap :mobile-qr-code: **View address**.
    1. Choose either your legacy or multichain address. For your multichain address, tap :desktop-edit: **Edit** to choose which chains you want your multichain address to feature.
    1. To copy your address, tap :mobile-copy: **Copy**.

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click :desktop-wallet: **Wallet**.
    1. Click :desktop-receive: **Receive**.
    1. Choose either your legacy or multichain address. For your multichain address, click :desktop-edit: **Edit** to choose which chains you want your multichain address to feature. 
    1. To copy your address, click :desktop-copy: **Copy address**.

## Your legacy and multichain addresses

In essence, your legacy and multichain addresses are the same address. If you're only interested in the Ethereum mainnet, you can safely use your legacy address.

The key difference between your legacy and multichain addresses is that your multichain address lists the blockchain networks you want to receive crypto on. This means that if you're using any [l2s or sidechains][understand-l2s-and-sidechains], your multichain address can help signal which chains you prefer. 

For example, if you're using Ethereum mainnet and Optimism but not Arbitrum, you can click :desktop-edit: Edit on your Multichain address screen and check the boxes next to the chains you want to use. The unselected chains do not show up in your address, letting the sender know you don't want to receive crypto on those chains.

## What to do if you didn't receive your crypto

If someone sent you crypto and you can't see it in your Status Wallet, here's what you can do:

- Ask the sender to share a [block explorer][understand-block-explorers] link for this transaction with you. Using the link, make sure they sent your crypto to the right address. If the transaction shows up as [processing][understand-transaction-statuses] on the block explorer, simply wait until it's completed. This can take longer than usual when the network's busy.
- Close and re-open your Status Wallet app.
- Check your internet connection. If you're using a third-party VPN, try turning it off and on again.
