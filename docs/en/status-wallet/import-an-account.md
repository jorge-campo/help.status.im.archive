# Import an account into your Status Wallet

If you already have crypto accounts, you can import them into your Status Wallet. To do so, you can use your recovery phrase, private key or Keycard.

!!! note
     Status Wallet only supports Ethereum and Ethereum-based chains.

## Import your recovery phrase or private key

To use your existing account with Status Wallet, import either your recovery phrase or private key. Both options are valid and retrieve the same account for you.

The key difference is that if you import your recovery phrase, you can choose to set a [custom derivation path][about-custom-derivation-paths] and generate new addresses. You can't do this with your private key. If you don't want to change your addresses, it doesn't matter whether you import your recovery phrase or private key.
