# If you see transactions you don't recognize

If there are transactions in your history for amounts you don't remember spending, it may mean someone else has access to your wallet.

Double-check your transaction history using a block explorer. For more details on how to use block explorers, check out [Understand block explorers][understand-block-explorers]. If you see the same unauthorized transactions both in your Status Wallet app and the block explorer, you need to act as fast as possible to protect your money.

## Create a new Wallet

If you have any crypto left in your current wallet, create a new wallet and transfer your remaining crypto there. Creating a new account in your Status Wallet app is not enough. For full security, you need to create a new recovery phrase for your wallet. For more details on how to do this, check out [If someone else has access to your wallet][if-someone-else-has-access-to-your-wallet].

## Protect your Wallet in future

- [x] **Learn more how to protect your crypto**. Understand what your recovery phrase is and [how to store it][back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase]. Anyone who has your recovery phrase can manage your crypto, which is why you should keep your recovery phrase in a safe place and never share it with anyone. You should also avoid keeping any digital copies of your recovery phrase on your devices: pen-and-paper copies are more secure. To learn more about common crypto scams and how to protect yourself, check out [Understand common scams][understand-common-scams].
- [x] **Be careful with downloading new apps**. No matter which platform you're using, double-check every app you install. Make sure it's from a reputable source. If in doubt, check the app's website to verify you're downloading the official version. Unverified or suspicious apps may contain viruses or other malware that can steal your crypto wallet data.
- [x] **Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks**. As a rule, anyone can scan phones and other devices that are using such networks. This means that a hacker can easily look through your phone's internal storage, including your local app data. If you have digital copies of your recovery phrase on your phone (for example, screenshots), hackers may see them. They may also have access to your internet traffic and target you if they notice anything crypto-related. To protect yourself, always use a VPN when you connect to an unprotected public WiFi network. You should also avoid keeping digital copies of your recovery phrase on your phone.
