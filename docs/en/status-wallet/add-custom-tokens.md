# Add custom tokens

!!! note
     For adding collectibles, check out [Your collectibles: your quick start guide][your-collectibles-your-quick-start-guide]. 

Status Wallet uses the [Uniswap default token list][uniswap-token-list]. In your Status Wallet app, you can only see tokens that are on that list. The only exception is custom tokens that Status Community owners mint. If you own these tokens, you can always see them in your Status Wallet app.

If you sent a token that isn't on the list to your Status Wallet address, your crypto isn't lost. You can [check up your address on a block explorer][understand-block-explorers] to see these and other tokens under your Token holdings. To manage these unsupported tokens, simply import your Status Wallet recovery phrase to another wallet app that supports that asset. For more details on how to do that, check out [Export your Status recovery phrase][export-your-status-recovery-phrase].
