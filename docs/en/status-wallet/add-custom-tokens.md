# Add custom tokens

!!! note
     For custom Status Community tokens, check out [Mint tokens for your community][mint-tokens-for-your-community]. 

Status Wallet uses [Uniswap's default token list][uniswap-token-list]. In your Status Wallet app, you can only see tokens that are on that list. The only exception is custom tokens that Status Community owners mint: you can always see these tokens in your Status Wallet app.

If you sent a token that isn't on the list to your Status Wallet address, your crypto isn't lost. You can [check up your address on a block explorer][understand-block-explorers] to see all of your tokens under Token holdings. To manage these unsupported tokens, simply [import your Status Wallet recovery phrase][export-your-recovery-phrase] to another wallet app that supports that asset.
