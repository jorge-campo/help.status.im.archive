# Understand your wallet balance

In [Status Wallet][status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide], you can see how much crypto you have in total and [in each account][manage-and-organize-your-accounts].

## Where your crypto is stored

Crypto wallets aren't bank apps: they're interfaces that help you interact with the blockchain. The blockchain is where your crypto is stored, and your crypto wallet app simply helps you access your balance and send transactions.

## Understand your crypto's fiat value

Status Wallet automatically converts your crypto to the currency of your choice (USD, EUR and so on). These estimates are there for your convenience and have no impact on the actual value of your crypto.

To double-check, you can always look up your address on a block explorer and verify the total cost of your crypto. For more details on how to do that, check out [Understand block explorers][understand-block-explorers].


## What to do if you can't see some of your crypto

Sometimes it takes longer for wallet apps to fetch the latest blockchain data. For example, this can happen if the blockchain network is overloaded or your internet connection is slower than usual. This doesn't affect your crypto in any way: once your connection is restored or the network is back to normal, the app can load the correct balance.

To double-check, look up your address on a block explorer and verify your balance. For more details on how to do that, check out [Understand block explorers][understand-block-explorers].

!!! warning
     If your crypto balance on the block explorer seems wrong and you see transactions you didn't make, check out [Handle transactions you didn't make][handle-transactions-you-didn-t-make].
