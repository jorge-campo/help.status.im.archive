# Delete your wallet

By design, any blockchain is decentralized and immutable. This means that once something is on a blockchain, it can't be deleted. That includes your wallet: once you get an address and make transactions, there's no way to delete your transaction history. As the name suggests, a blockchain is a chain of blocks. Deleting the blocks from your transaction would mean breaking off the entire chain that follows.

If you no longer need your Status Wallet, simply [send your leftover crypto to some other wallet address][send-crypto-to-someone-else] and uninstall the app. Remember that blockchains are pseudonymous: unless you sent crypto to your Status Wallet from a centralized crypto exchange, there's no way to trace your address to your real identity.

*[pseudonymous]: Sending crypto transactions is the same as posting messages on a forum under a pseudonym. Anyone can see which address each transaction was sent from, but unless you willingly reveal your identity, it's impossible to trace your internet pseudonym (or crypto address) to your real-life identity.
