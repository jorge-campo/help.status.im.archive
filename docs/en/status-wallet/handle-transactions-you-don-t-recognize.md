# Handle transactions you don't recognize

If there are transactions in your history for amounts you don't remember spending, it might mean someone else has access to your wallet.

Double-check your transaction history using a block explorer. For more details on how to use block explorers, check out [Understand block explorers][understand-block-explorers]. If you see the same unauthorized transactions both in your Status Wallet app and the block explorer, you need to act as fast as possible to protect your money.

For full security, you need to create a new recovery phrase for your wallet. For more details on how to do this, check out [Create a new wallet][create-a-new-wallet].
- [x] Learn more about what your recovery phrase is and [how to protect your crypto from scammers][back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase]. Anyone who has your recovery phrase can manage your crypto, which is why you should keep your recovery phrase in a safe place and never share it with anyone.
