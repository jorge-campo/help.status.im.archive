# Understand network fees

To [send your crypto to someone else][send-crypto], you need to pay network fees. Network fees are charged by the blockchain network to process your transaction.

!!! note
     [Status Wallet][status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide] doesn't charge any extra transaction fees. The only fees you need to pay are charged by the blockchain. Those fees remain the same no matter which wallet app you're using.

## The basics

- Network fees are charged by validators to process your transaction. Validators are network participants who use their computers to validate blockchain transactions.
- Status Wallet doesn't charge any extra transaction fees.
- You can [set custom network fees][set-custom-network-fees] for your transactions. If you set the network fee too low, it can take much longer for your transaction to be processed.

## Who is charging network fees and why

When you send a blockchain transaction, it needs to be processed and validated by the network. This involves the work of validators, who use powerful computers to validate transactions. By sending a transaction, you create a job validators compete for. Every job needs to be paid, so you pay network fees to compensate validators for their work.

A network fee's size depends on how busy the blockchain is, as well as the size of your transaction. The more transactions are waiting to be validated, the higher the fees get.

Network fees are measured in gas, which in turn is measured in gwei. Gwei are units of Ether (ETH), much like cents are units of dollars.

## What happens if you set the network fees too low

!!! note
     If you set your network fees too low, it may take longer for your transaction to be verified by the network. In some cases, it may never be processed at all.

Blockchain transactions can be compared to job offers, where the sender is the employer and the validator is the candidate. The employer who's offering the highest pay gets the most applicants and can fill the position faster.

Validators invest their time and resources into processing transactions, which includes using computer hardware that consumes electricity. The fees they receive compensate for their efforts. For example, if the average fee for processing a transaction is $10, offering a $5 fee may not cover the validator's electricity costs. This means it may take much longer for your transaction be processed, or even that it may never be processed at all.

If you accidentally sent a transaction with a custom network fee that's too low, check out [Handle pending or stuck transactions][handle-pending-or-stuck-transactions]. If you want to cancel your transaction, check out [Cancel transactions][cancel-transactions].
