# Understand network fees

To send your crypto to someone else, you need to pay network fees.

!!! note
     Status Wallet doesn't charge any extra transaction fees. The only fees you need to pay are charged by the blockchain. Those fees remain the same no matter which wallet app you're using.

## Who is charging network fees and why

When you send a blockchain transaction, it needs to be processed and validated by the network. This involves the work of miners, who use powerful computers to validate transactions. By sending a transaction, you create a job miners compete for. Every job needs to be paid, so you pay network fees to compensate miners for their work.

A network fee's size depends on how busy the blockchain is, as well as the size of your transaction. Network fees are measured in gas, which in turn is measured in gwei. Gwei are units of Ether, much like cents are units of dollars.

## What happens if you set the network fees too low

!!! note
     If you set your network fees too low, it may take longer for your transaction to be verified by the network. In some cases, it may never be processed at all.

Blockchain transactions can be compared to job offers, where the sender is the employer and the miner is the candidate. The employer who's offering the highest pay gets the most applicants and can fill the position faster.

Miners invest their time and resources into processing transactions, which includes using computer hardware that consumes electricity. The fees they receive compensate for their efforts. For example, if the average fee for processing a transaction is $10, offering a $5 fee may not cover the miner's electricity costs. This means it may take much longer for your transaction be processed, or even that it may never be processed at all.

If you accidentally sent a transaction with a custom network fee that's too low, check out [Handle pending or stuck transactions][handle-pending-or-stuck-transactions]. If you want to cancel your transaction, check out [Cancel transactions][cancel-transactions].
