# If someone else has access to your Wallet

Your Status Wallet and profile share the same recovery phrase. While your profile is protected by a password locally, anyone who has the recovery phrase can log in to your profile even without your password.

If you think someone else has access to your wallet (for example, you [see transactions in your history that you don't recognize][handle-transactions-you-don-t-recognize]), you should create a new Status profile and transfer your crypto to your new Wallet.

## Step 1. Create a new Status profile

Start with creating a new Status profile. You can use multiple profiles at the same time, so you're not losing access to your current profile. For more details on how to create an extra profile, see [Create and use additional Status profiles][create-and-use-additional-status-profiles].

## Step 2. Transfer your remaining crypto to your new Status Wallet
