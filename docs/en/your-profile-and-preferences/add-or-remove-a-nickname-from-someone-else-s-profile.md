# Add or remove a nickname from someone else's profile

Nicknames are familiar or custom names you can assign to people you interact with in Status. Nicknames offer a practical solution for remembering names that may be difficult to recall or distinguish.

!!! note
    Nicknames you add to others are personal and only visible to you.

When you assign a nickname to someone, the Status app prioritises displaying the nickname over the original name chosen by the contact. The nickname and the contact's original name are always visible.

!!! tip
    You can give nicknames to anyone in Status, not only your contacts. You can't add a nickname to yourself.
