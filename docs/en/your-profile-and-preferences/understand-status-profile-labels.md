# Understand Status profile labels

In Status, you can label profiles as trusted or untrusted. This is useful when you want to be able to quickly tell your contacts from possible impersonators.

Identity verification and profile labels help you keep in mind whether you should trust someone without alerting them to your decision.

!!! note
    To see a label on someone's profile, [mark this profile as trusted or untrusted][verify-your-contacts-identity].


### The basics

- You can mark other users' Status profiles with labels.
- Only you can see these labels in others' profiles. The person you mark doesn't see the label and isn't notified about your decision.
- These labels have no impact on your contact's status. For example, if you mark a contact as untrusted, this doesn't remove them from your contact list.

## Status profile labels

If you're in doubt about your Status contact's identity, you can [send them an identity verification request][verify-your-contacts-identity]. In this request, you ask a question only this person can know the answer to.

Depending on their response, you then mark them as trusted or untrusted. Once you do, a label appears next to their profile name: :mobile-trusted: Trusted or :mobile-untrusted: Untrusted. By default, those you add to your contacts get the :mobile-contact: Contact label.
