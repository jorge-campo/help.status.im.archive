# Customize direct message notifications

By default, you receive notifications for direct messages (DMs). You can customize the DM notifications and receive only the ones relevant to you.

In addition to DM notifications, you also receive notifications for mentions. For example, if you mute someone, they can still mention you in a community channel or group chat. To customize your mention notifications, read [Customize mentions and other messages][customize-mentions-and-other-messages].
