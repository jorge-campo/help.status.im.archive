# Customize community and channel notifications

You can customize the messages and mentions notifications you receive in communities and channels. By doing so, you only receive the notifications relevant to you.

The notifications you customize for a community apply to all its channels. For example, suppose you decide to [mute all community notifications][#mute-all-community-notifications]. In that case, you won't receive any notification from any channel, even if someone mentions you. To customize notifications for specific channels, check out Set up and customize notification exceptions.

This article describes common examples.

- [Mute all community notifications.](#mute-all-community-notifications)
- [Mute community notifications except global mentions.](#mute-community-notifications-except-global-mentions)
- [Set the same settings for all community message types.](#set-the-same-settings-for-all-community-message-types)

## Mute community notifications

You can turn off your notifications for specific communities for a designated period. When you mute all notifications for a community, a :desktop-mute: **Mute** icon appears next to the community name.

=== "Mobile"

    1. From the tab bar, tap :mobile-communities: **Communities**.
    1. Tap the community you want to mute and, in the top navigation, tap :mobile-more-options: **More options**.
    1. Tap :mobile-mute: **Mute community**.
    1. Choose for how long you'd like to mute your notifications.

=== "Desktop"  

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click :desktop-settings: **Settings**.
    1. From the settings sidebar, click :desktop-communities: **Communities**.
    1. Choose the community you want to mute and click :desktop-notification: **Mute**.

!!! tip
	To turn notifications back on, open the muted community, then tap :mobile-more-options: **More options** > :mobile-unmute: **Unmute community**.

## Mute community notifications except global mentions

If you want to avoid missing general announcements, you can selectively mute some notifications, except global mentions (such as `@everyone`). This example explains how to turn off all notifications for a specific community while maintaining global mentions. This can be helpful in very active communities where you're only interested in global mentions, such as `@everyone`.

=== "Mobile"

    1. From the tab bar, tap :mobile-communities: **Communities**.
    1. Tap the community you want to mute and, in the top navigation, tap :mobile-more-options: **More options**.
    1. Tap :mobile-notifications-settings: **Notification settings**.
    1. Select **Personal mentions** > **Notifications off**.
    1. Select **All other messages** > **Notifications off**.
    1. Make sure **Global mentions** is set to **On**. If it is not, select **Global mentions** > **Notifications on**.

=== "Desktop"  

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click :desktop-settings: **Settings**.
    1. From the **Settings sidebar**, click :desktop-notification: **Notifications and Sounds**.
    1. Scroll down to the **Exceptions** area and click :desktop-add: **Add** next to the group chat you want to mute.
    1. Select **Personal mentions** > **Turn off**. 
    1. Select **All other messages** > **Turn off**.
    1. On the same pop-up menu, verify **Global mentions** is set to **Send alerts**. If it is not, then select **Global mentions** > **Send Alerts**.
    1. Click **Done**. 

## Set the same notification setting for all messages in a community

Currently, you can only set the same settings for all community message types using Status mobile.

=== "Mobile"

    1. From the tab bar, tap :mobile-communities: **Communities**.
    1. Tap the community you want to customize and, in the top navigation, tap :mobile-more-options: **More options**.
    1. Tap :mobile-notifications-settings: **Notification settings**.
    1. Turn on **Same settings for all messages types**.
