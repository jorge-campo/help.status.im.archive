# Verify your contact's identity

If you're not sure your Status contact is who they claim to be, you can send them an identity verification request. For example, you can make sure they're actually your former classmate or coworker and not an impersonator. 

In your verification request, you're asking a question only this person can know the answer to. If they respond correctly, you mark them with the Trusted label. If not, you mark them as untrusted and can either keep them as a contact, remove them from your contacts or block them. For more details on profile labels, check out [Understand Status profile labels][understand-status-profile-labels].

### What to expect 

- You're the only person who can see the labels you chose for others' profiles. Your contacts aren't notified about your decision and can't see whether you marked them as trusted or untrusted.
- You can mark someone untrusted and still keep them as your contact. This can be useful if you don't want them to realize you don't trust them.
