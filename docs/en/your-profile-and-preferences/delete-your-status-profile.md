# Delete your Status profile

Status uses a [peer-to-peer network][peer-to-peer-messaging] that temporarily stores your profile information and data. Because of this decentralized network, there is no one-click way to delete your profile and all associated data.

## What to expect

- The only way to delete your Status profile is to stop using it for 30 days or more.
- Once your profile is deleted, it's irretrievably lost. You can always create a new Status profile.
- Deleting your Status profile doesn't remove your wallet funds. Your wallet funds are safe and available if you know [your recovery phrase] [create-or-restore-your-status-profile-using-a-recovery-phrase].

## Delete your Status Profile

Here are things you can do if you want to stop using a profile:

- [Transfer assets][send-crypto] out of your Status wallet.
- Inform your contacts the profile is out of use.
- [Leave group chats][leave-a-group-chat] and [communities][leave-a-community] you joined.
- [Edit your profile][edit-your-profile] and remove your personal information.
- [Remove your profile][remove-a-status-profile] from all your devices and leave it inactive for 30 days.
