# Delete your Status profile

Because Status uses a [peer-to-peer network] to store data and messages, there is no one-click way to delete your profile and all associated data.

Here are things you can do if you want to stop using a profile:

- Inform your contacts the profile is out of use.
- [Leave group chats][leave-a-group-chat] and [communities][leave-a-community] you joined.
- [Edit your profile][edit-your-profile] and remove your personal information.
- [Transfer assets][send-crypto] out of your wallet.
- [Remove your profile][remove-a-status-profile] from all your devices and leave it inactive for 30 days.
