# Customize membership request notifications

!!! note ""
    Currently, you can only customize membership request notifications in the Status mobile app.

 If [manual request approval][manage-community-join-requests] is required to join your community, you receive a notification every time someone requests to join.  

There are three notification options you can choose from: `Notification on`, `In notification centre only` and `Notifications off`. For each one of them, follow the same procedure and use the table below as a reference.

!!! note
    Since there's currently no way to customize notifications in the Status Desktop app, you can [mute all notification sounds][mute-your-notifications] if you are receiving too many notification requests.
