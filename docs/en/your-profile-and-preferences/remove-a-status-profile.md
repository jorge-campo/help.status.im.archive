# Remove a Status profile

If you don't want a profile to show up on your device, you can remove it.

!!! note
    A removed profile is not deleted. Check out [Delete your Status profile][delete-your-status-profile].

## What to expect

- When you remove a profile from one device, the associated data is deleted from that device. To delete the data from all devices, repeat the procedure on all devices you use the profile.
- Some data stays on other users' devices. For example:
    - The messages you sent are still accessible to the recipients, whether they are direct messages or messages in a group chat or community.
    - People still can see all information you display on your profile screen. For example, your profile name, photo, bio and linked social media.
- You can no longer use a profile if you don't log into it for more than 30 days.
