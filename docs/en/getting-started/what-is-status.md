# What is Status?

Status is an open-source super app combining messaging, communities, a crypto wallet and a web3 browser.

At Status, privacy isn't a buzzword but a principle that shapes our design and technology. You don't need to share personal details, such as phone number, email or credit card information to use Status. We've designed the Status app to prevent any entity (including Status) from reading your conversations, censoring your content or blocking your access to the app.

Customization is a key feature of the Status app. You can alter colour schemes and decide what aspects of your profile to hide or showcase. If you choose to, you can make your profile public and visible to those outside of Status.

!!! note
    The Status app is available on mobile, desktop and web.

## Status Communities: your self-sovereign space

Status Communities are self-sovereign spaces where you're in control. Each community sets its rules and bears responsibility for its actions.

Communities are decentralized, powered by members using the Status desktop app. Anyone can create their own Status Community for free, and there's no cost involved in running one. Your community is entirely under your control. No one, not even us, can shut it down, block access or interfere with its operation.

!!! tip
    You can import your existing Discord community into Status Communities.

You can customize the look of your community, decide whether it's public or private, or make it token-gated using ERC-20, collectibles (NFTs) and ENS names so that only holders of certain crypto tokens can join.

!!! note
    Community owners in Status can foster community engagement and participation by minting their own crypto tokens and distributing them via airdrops.

## Status Messaging: your private communication channel

Status messaging secures your direct messages or group chats using strong end-to-end encryption (E2EE). While other messaging apps support E2EE, Status also includes metadata privacy and perfect forward secrecy. Thanks to metadata privacy, we can't track your communications and know who you're talking to. Perfect forward secrecy is a security feature that prevents past messages from being decrypted even if your private key is compromised.

The messaging service is fully decentralized and powered by Waku, a peer-to-peer protocol for private, secure and censorship-resistant communication.

All the modern messaging features you expect are included. You can react to messages, share GIFs, emojis, stickers, voice messages or send crypto, all within a secure environment.

!!! note
    No one, not even Status, can access your conversations.

## Status Wallet: your secure crypto vault

Status Wallet offers a secure place to manage all your crypto assets, including Ethereum-based assets and collectibles. As a self-custody wallet, you have exclusive control over your crypto assets and no one else can freeze or lockout your tokens.

In addition to Ethereum, the Status Wallet supports other Layer-2 blockchain networks fully committed to decentralization, such as Optimism and Artbitrum. You can send and receive crypto across different networks using a simple interface. The Status Wallet calculates the most cost-effective way to move tokens from one place to another, considering gas prices and bridge costs (transfer costs).

## Status web3 browser: your gateway to the decentralized web

With the Status web3 browser, you can access decentralized apps (dApps) with enhanced security and integrated cryptocurrency wallet support. Unlike traditional web2 browsers, the Status web3 browser focuses on your privacy and anonymity.

Status is not just an app, it's a secure communication tool upholding rights, enabling information flow, protecting privacy and promoting sovereignty. To start your journey with decentralized communication, download Status today.
